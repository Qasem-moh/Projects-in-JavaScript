Typing Speed Test Game in HTML CSS & JavaScript

In this video, I have shown you how to create a Typing Speed Test Game in HTML CSS & JavaScript. In this game, the max time for typing is 60 seconds. Once you start typing, you'll see your mistakes, WPM (Word Per Minute), and CPM (Character Per Minute) at the bottom. You can also erase your incorrect characters or go backward by pressing the backspace key.
